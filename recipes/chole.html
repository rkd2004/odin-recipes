    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpea curry (chole) and fried bread (bhature).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For Chole:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can chickpeas (or 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked and cooked)</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Bhature:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour milk into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium heat; watch carefully to prevent milk from boiling over. When milk begins to boil, pour buttermilk into the pot in a steady stream, stirring constantly. The milk will separate into curds and water.</li>
        <li>Line a colander with cheesecloth. Pour milk mixture through the cheesecloth, reserving some of the strained liquid. Let milk mixture sit in the colander until curds are settled and dripping stops, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer strained curds to a food processor. Process until smooth and mixture can be formed into a ball. Add some of the reserved liquid and process again if mixture is too dry. The consistency should resemble firm ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li>Turn cheese out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth. Form into a ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>To cook paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cut paneer into bite-sized pieces. Fry in hot oil until very pale golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
